   <h3> About the State Data Plan </h3>
   <p> <a href="CTDataPlanPhase1.pdf" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Download and Print the Plan</a> </p>

<p>The State Data Plan is required to be developed in accordance with <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2018/ACT/pa/2018PA-00175-R00HB-05517-PA.htm">Public Act 18-175 </a>. Specifically the Act requires that the state data plan shall: </p>

  
  <ol>
  <li> establish management and data analysis standards across all executive branch agencies, </li>
  <li> include specific, achievable goals within the two years following adoption of such plan, as well as longer term goals, </li>
  <li> make recommendations to enhance standardization and integration of data systems and data management practices across all executive branch agencies, </li>
  <li> provide a timeline for a review of any state or federal legal concerns or other obstacles to the internal sharing of data among agencies, including security and privacy concerns, and </li>
  <li> set goals for improving the open data repository. </li> 
  </ul>
 
 <p> An initial draft of the plan is due on or before November 1, 2018 with a final plan due December 31, 2018. The plan is required to be updated every two years thereafter.</p>
 
<p> Once final, information technology actions of affected state agencies are required to be consistent with the plan. Further, the Chief Data Officer is required to 
establish procedures for each affected agency to reports on the agency’s progress toward achieving the goals articulated in the plan.</p>

<h3> Process:</h3>

<p>The plan will be developed iteratively, in phases, each with an opportunity for both public and agency input.</p>

<ul>    
<li> Phase 1: Release and feedback on a broad set of principles and goals to guide the development of the plan and establish a vision for improving the management, use, and sharing of data for state agencies. Additionally, this phase includes several “Focal Points” or areas where the state should focus its efforts for the initial 2 year period that the plan will cover. </li>
<li> Phase 2: Finalize state data plan principles and add more specific actions under each principle that will assist in guiding agency actions. Finalize the overarching goals and supplement with more specific measureable objectives that will advance each goal. Finalize “Focal Points” and supplement with additional steps to help advance implementation. Collect feedback from both the public and state agencies.</li>
<li> Phase 3: Present a draft of the state data plan for review and feedback from the Data Analysis Technology Advisory board established pursuant to Public Act 18-175 </li>
</ul>
 <h3> Ackowledgement:</h3>
    <p> Connecticut's process and framework is based on an approach currently being used at the federal level in the formulation of the <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Strategy.</a>
   In addition to using a similar process to the <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Stratgey</a> we have also incporporated some of the principles articulated in that strategy. Finally, we have also considered and incporporated
   elements from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zagr7fIppy8085fmKZcUS4XnQ0BYaNSk/view"> Statewide Data Strategy Principles and Goals </a> established
   by the Colorado Government Data Advisory Board.
